### Overview
This is a small iOS application I made in the process of learning swift and Objective-C iterations. 
It is a simple todo list. It's not the greatest thing, but it's a reflection of my learning. 

### Requirements
The obvious requirements are...
1. You need OSX machine and Xcode or some equivelent IDE with a Swift 4 support for compilation. 
2. You need to be human. Because I can't think of other requirements.
